# We want to enqueue initrd-cleanup.service/start after we finished the part
# above. It can't be part of the initial transaction, because non-oneshot units
# use Conflicts=initrd-cleanup.service to be terminated before we switch root.
# Effectively, initrd-parse-etc.service acts as a synchronization point after
# which cleanup of the initrd processes starts.
