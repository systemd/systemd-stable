You are looking for the traditional init scripts in {{ SYSTEM_SYSVINIT_PATH }},
and they are gone?

Here's an explanation on what's going on:

You are running a systemd-based OS where traditional init scripts have
been replaced by native systemd services files. Service files provide
very similar functionality to init scripts. To make use of service
files simply invoke "systemctl", which will output a list of all
currently running services (and other units). Use "systemctl
list-unit-files" to get a listing of all known unit files, including
stopped, disabled and masked ones. Use "systemctl start
foobar.service" and "systemctl stop foobar.service" to start or stop a
service, respectively. For further details, please refer to
systemctl(1).

Note that traditional init scripts continue to function on a systemd
system. An init script {{ SYSTEM_SYSVINIT_PATH }}/foobar is implicitly mapped
into a service unit foobar.service during system initialization.

Thank you!
